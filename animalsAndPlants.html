                    <h3><u>Introduction about Animals</u></h3>
                    <p>
                        Animals (also called Metazoa) are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological 
                        kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen,
                        are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and go through an ontogenetic stage in which 
                        their body consists of a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic
                        development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described of which around
                        1 million are insects but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species 
                        in total.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). 
                        They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming
                        intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology.
                        Most living animal species are in Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally
                        symmetric body plan. The Bilateria include the protostomes, containing invertebrates
                        such as nematodes, arthropods, and molluscs, and the deuterostomes, containing the 
                        echinoderms and the chordates, the latter including the vertebrates. Life forms 
                        interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the 
                        late Precambrian. Many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil 
                        record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, which began around 542 million
                        years ago. 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; 
                        these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago.

                                    In addition to the natural nectar, butterflies are fed with artificially 
                                    provided bee honey and fruit juice and also fresh fruit pieces are provided 
                                    to suck juices. Not only butterflies but other stages of butterfly life cycle 
                                    also display there, in order to educate visitors

                    <h3><u>Introduction about Plants</u></h3>
                    <p>
                        Plants are mainly multicellular organisms, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes
                        of the kingdom Plantae. Historically, plants were treated as one of two kingdoms 
                        including all living things that were not animals, and all algae and fungi were 
                        treated as plants. However, all current definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi 
                        and some algae, as well as the prokaryotes (the archaea and bacteria).  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By one definition, plants form the clade Viridiplantae (Latin name for "green plants"), 
                        a group that includes the flowering plants, conifers and other gymnosperms, ferns 
                        and their allies, hornworts, liverworts, mosses, and the green algae, but excludes
                        the red and brown algae. Green plants obtain most of their energy from sunlight via 
                        photosynthesis by primary chloroplasts that are derived from endosymbiosis with 
                        cyanobacteria. Their chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b, which gives them their
                        green color. Some plants are parasitic or mycotrophic and have lost the ability to produce normal 
                        amounts of chlorophyll or to photosynthesize, but still have flowers,fruits, and seeds.
                        Plants are characterized by sexual reproduction and alternation of generations, 
                        although asexual reproduction is also common.

                                    Plants in a strict sense include the green algae, and land plants that 
                                    emerged within them, including stoneworts. The relationships between 
                                    plant groups are still being worked out, and the names given to them 
                                    vary considerably. The clade Viridiplantae encompasses a group of organisms 
                                    that have cellulose in their cell walls, possess chlorophylls a and b and 
                                    have plastids bound by only two membranes that are capable of photosynthesis 
                                    and of storing starch. This clade is the main subject of this article 
                                    (e.g : Plantae Copeland).
