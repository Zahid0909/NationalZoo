                        Sri Lanka, formerly known as Ceylon, and officially the Democratic Socialist Republic of 
                        Sri Lanka, is an island country in South Asia. It lies in the Indian Ocean, southwest of
                        the Bay of Bengal, and southeast of the Arabian Sea; it is separated from the Indian 
                        subcontinent by the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait. Sri Lanka shares a maritime border
                        with India and the Maldives. Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is its legislative capital, and
                        Colombo is its largest city and financial centre.<br>

                        location and deep harbors have made it of great strategic importance, from the earliest
                        days of the ancient Silk Road trade route to today's so-called maritime Silk Road.Because 
                        its location made it a major trading hub, it was already known to both Far Easterners and
                        Europeans as long ago as the Anuradhapura period.During a period of great political 
                        crisis in the Sinhalese kingdom of Kotte, the Portuguese arrived in Sri Lanka 
                        (largely by accident) and then sought to control the island's maritime regions and its 
                        lucrative external trade.

                        ethnicities. The Sinhalese are the majority of the nation's population. The Tamils, 
                        who are a large minority group,have also played an influential role in the island's 
                        history. Other long established groups include the:

                        The Dehiwala National Zoo, which has a remarkable collection of exotic and 
                        indigenous fauna,is one of the oldest Zoos in Asia. The Zoo in Sri Lanka is widely 
                        known as Colombo Zoo all over the world.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        Currently, Dehiwala Zoo houses 72 species of Mammals, 65 species of Birds, 31 
                        species of Reptiles, 89 species of Fish, 03 families of Amphibians and 30 species 
                        of Butterflies etc. The total number of animals varies from 2500-3000 due to breeding
                        and free living colonies of birds. Dehiwala Zoo has become famous among the visitors 
                        not only for collection of local and exotic animals but also for landscaping with lush
                        greeneries. The Zoo supports and promotes conservation by breeding certain rare and 
                        endangered species through proper animal welfare.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Annually, over one and half million local and foreign tourists visit the Zoo. And over
                        2000 students and groups of students from schools and universities visit the Zoo for 
                        educational purposes. The Zoo is trying to keep the pace with the changing world. It 
                        has been involved in some major redevelopment programmes with the aim of enhancing 
                        the overall image of the Zoo while providing maximum facilities for animals and the 
                        visitors.

                        One of the most basic “laws” of science is that plants are plants and animals are animals. 
                        Right? Of course! Plants are green. They live using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and 
                        nutrients, making their own food through the process of photosynthesisThe process by which 
                        green plants and plant-like algae use sunlight, together with carbon dioxide and water, to 
                        make their own food.. In contrast, animals live by eating other organisms (plants, animals, 
                        bacteria, or even bits and pieces of dead organisms). Is this “law” of science correct? Not 
                        always! Going against this “law” are oceans full of microscopic organisms that can be both 
                        plant-like and animal-like at the same time! They photosynthesize and eat.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        PhytoplanktonPlankton are drifting or floating organisms in the sea or in freshwater. Most 
                        are microscopic. When plant-like, they are called phytoplankton, and when animal-like, they 
                        are called zooplankton. Small-sized zooplankton are termed microzooplankton. are microscopic 
                        plant-like organisms that live in the water. Their name tells us that they live on light (phyto) 
                        and drift with the water (plankton). Every drop of water normally contains hundreds of thousands 
                        of these tiny, single-celled organisms. Phytoplankton are natural and important; they produce 50% 
                        of the oxygen in the air we breathe, and they are also food for fish and other animals in the ocean. 
                        There are many hundreds of different types of phytoplankton. For decades, most scientists have thought 
                        that phytoplankton lived only by photosynthesis. It turns out that many of these phytoplankton also 
                        eat the way animals do. Some eat other phytoplankton, some eat bacteria, and some eat tiny animals. 
                        Some of these mixotroph phytoplankton eat only reluctantly or rarely. Some are aggressive and can 
                        stuff themselves full of food! These mixotrophs grow much faster when they can eat and photosynthesize 
                        at the same time, compared with when they grow by photosynthesis alone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Along with phytoplankton, there are other, tiny animal-like organisms in the ocean that are called 
                        microzooplanktonPlankton are drifting or floating organisms in the sea or in freshwater. Most are 
                        microscopic. When plant-like, they are called phytoplankton, and when animal-like, they are called 
                        zooplankton. Small-sized zooplankton are termed microzooplankton., because they are small (micro-), 
                        animal (zoo)like plankton. Microzooplankton eat lots of different things, but when they eat tiny 
                        phytoplankton, they can become part-time plants. How can they do this? One type of microzooplankton 
                        eats phytoplankton, but they do not digest the photosynthesizing machinery (the 
                        chloroplastsPhotosynthesizing apparatus in plants and marine phytoplankton. 
                        They keep the stolen chloroplasts and use these to photosynthesize! Can you imagine the broccoli 
                        you eat continuing to photosynthesize in your stomach after you ate it? Other “animal” mixotrophs 
                        eat lots of phytoplankton but do not digest them at all–they keep the intact phytoplankton within 
                        their bodies and drift in the oceans like microscopic greenhouses; they live off the photosynthesis 
                        from the still-growing phytoplankton they ate.
